PenTest Notes:

SQL injection does not work on the site, no vulnerabilities found.

Users ARE able to make fake accounts using fake or non-existing emails, however they cannot 
verify, users are able to use temp addresses to signup, this could be combatted by limiting
the emails to @google, @yahoo, @live, @hotmail etc

Good use of character limit on verification page

On signup the password "strength" calls a password of pass1234 a "Strong" password 

Site asks for cookies for most information inclduing control of midi devices and location
services
